3. Description

This project implements a Huffman Coding Tree using Python to compress data by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequent characters. This version ensures that characters with equal frequencies are sorted in alphabetical order within the tree.

4. Getting Started
Dependencies
Python 3.x: Required to run the code in Google Colab.
Google Colab: Recommended for running the program easily without needing to install Python locally.

How to run the program

Open the Colab link provided above.
Copy and paste the code into a code cell in the Colab notebook.
Run the cell to start the Huffman encoding process.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
Run the code cell in Colab to initialize the Huffman Coding program.
The program will prompt you to enter the number of unique characters.
For each character, input the character (either uppercase or lowercase; they will be treated case-insensitively) and its frequency.
Once all inputs are provided, the program will display the Huffman Tree and the Huffman codes assigned to each character.
